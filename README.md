# AB-Hypothesis-Testing

Due to the launch of an upcoming marketing campaign, our e-commerce website has made plans to re-work the essential landing page of our front-end. Before our company totally commits to the change, it has been decided that the effectiveness of the new layout should be evaluated utilizing A/B hypothesis testing against the original design baseline, to determine if a significant website landing page overhaul would yield a higher conversion rate before the new marketing campaign initiative officially launches.
